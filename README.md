# L1

This repo is a Haskell interpreter and type inferer for the L1 Language. The L1 language, a pedagogical language, is a simple Touring complete subset of standard ML. It is used in the course "Semantics of Programming Languages", which is part of the Cambridge University Computer Science and Technology degree. The course was originally created by Professor Peter Sewell and is currently taught by Dr Neel Krishnaswami. 

My assumption is that Professor Peter Sewell invented L1. He created the course and the ML and OCaml implementations of the L1 interpreter and type inferer.

I created the project to better learn how the language works and to practice Haskell! The code looks cleaner and shorter in Haskell (IMHO) - this might be because the ML/OCaml versions were kept basic to help 2nd year undergraduates understand them - rather than some innate superiority of Haskell :-)
